# Anomaly-detection
EDA is performed on Cyclone Preheater dataset. Understanding the dataset, cleaning the data, choosing pertinent features, and displaying the data are all steps in the EDA process for anomaly detection with Isolation Forest. A tree-based ensemble technique called Isolation Forest effectively isolates anomalies by randomly splitting along feature space. Using measures like precision, recall, or ROC curve, fine-tune the parameters and assess the performance of the model. Visual anomaly detection is aided by EDA, and the iterative process allows the analysis to be improved with input from subject-matter experts. One can efficiently identify anomalies and obtain insights into data patterns and outliers by combining EDA and Isolation Forest.
